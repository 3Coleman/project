Detailed Steps
1. Set Up the Development Environment
ESP32 Environment:
Follow the ESP-IDF setup guide to install the necessary tools.
Install Python libraries: pip install pyserial pytest.
2. ESP32 Firmware Development
RTOS Task Creation:

Implement multiple FreeRTOS tasks to simulate different functionalities. For example:

Task 1: Blink an LED at a regular interval.
Task 2: Control a digital output based on received commands.
Task 3: Log the status of other tasks periodically.
Example FreeRTOS Task Implementation:

c
Copy code
#include <freertos/FreeRTOS.h>
#include <freertos/task.h>
#include <driver/gpio.h>

#define LED_PIN GPIO_NUM_2
#define LOG_TASK_PRIORITY 5
#define CONTROL_TASK_PRIORITY 4
#define BLINK_TASK_PRIORITY 3

void blink_task(void *pvParameter) {
    gpio_pad_select_gpio(LED_PIN);
    gpio_set_direction(LED_PIN, GPIO_MODE_OUTPUT);
    while (1) {
        gpio_set_level(LED_PIN, 1);  // Turn LED on
        vTaskDelay(1000 / portTICK_PERIOD_MS);
        gpio_set_level(LED_PIN, 0);  // Turn LED off
        vTaskDelay(1000 / portTICK_PERIOD_MS);
    }
}

void control_task(void *pvParameter) {
    // Example command handling task
    while (1) {
        // Add code to handle commands
        vTaskDelay(5000 / portTICK_PERIOD_MS);  // Simulate work
    }
}

void log_task(void *pvParameter) {
    while (1) {
        printf("Logging status...\n");  // Output logs
        vTaskDelay(10000 / portTICK_PERIOD_MS);  // Log every 10 seconds
    }
}

void app_main() {
    xTaskCreate(blink_task, "blink_task", 2048, NULL, BLINK_TASK_PRIORITY, NULL);
    xTaskCreate(control_task, "control_task", 2048, NULL, CONTROL_TASK_PRIORITY, NULL);
    xTaskCreate(log_task, "log_task", 2048, NULL, LOG_TASK_PRIORITY, NULL);
}
Command Handling:

Implement a task that reads commands from a serial interface (UART) and performs actions based on the received commands.
Logging and Monitoring:

Use printf or another logging mechanism to output task statuses and other relevant information.
3. Python Test Automation
Serial Communication:

Write Python scripts to open a serial port and send commands to the ESP32.
Example Python script to send a command:
python
Copy code
import serial

ser = serial.Serial('COM3', 115200)  # Adjust COM port and baud rate
ser.write(b'START_BLINK')
response = ser.readline().decode('utf-8').strip()
print(response)
Command Sending and Response Verification:

Develop Python scripts to automate sending commands and verifying the ESP32's responses.
Example script to send a command and check for a specific response:
python
Copy code
import requests

def send_command(command):
    url = 'http://esp32-address/control'
    response = requests.post(url, data={'command': command})
    return response.text

def test_command_response():
    result = send_command('START_BLINK')
    assert result == 'OK', f"Expected 'OK', got {result}"

test_command_response()
Log Analysis:

Collect and analyze logs from the ESP32. You might read logs from the serial port or a file if logs are saved.

Example script to collect and analyze logs:

python
Copy code
import serial

ser = serial.Serial('COM3', 115200)  # Adjust COM port and baud rate
logs = []

def read_logs():
    while True:
        line = ser.readline().decode('utf-8').strip()
        if line:
            logs.append(line)
            print(line)
        if 'END_OF_LOGS' in line:
            break

read_logs()
4. Unit Testing
Python Unit Tests:

Write unit tests for your Python scripts using unittest or pytest.
Example unit test using pytest:
python
Copy code
import pytest

def test_send_command():
    result = send_command('START_BLINK')
    assert result == 'OK'
Firmware Testing:

Test the functionality of FreeRTOS tasks by sending commands and verifying their effect (e.g., LED blinking, control responses).
5. Documentation and Version Control
GitHub:

Create a GitHub repository for your project.
Push your code, documentation, and test scripts to the repository.
Documentation:

Provide a README file with instructions on setting up the development environment, flashing the ESP32, running Python tests, and using the system.
Document key parts of the code, including FreeRTOS task creation and command handling.
Conclusion
This project will showcase your hands-on experience with ESP32, FreeRTOS, task monitoring, and test automation. By developing FreeRTOS tasks, implementing command handling, and automating tests using Python, youâ€™ll demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of these technologies. Make sure to document and version-control your work on GitHub for a strong addition to your resume.
